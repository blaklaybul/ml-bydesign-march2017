# Spillter

Humanity has created beautiful things and in doing so has also wrought damage to its home, planet earth. Spillter allows anyone to apply and oil spill effect to any landscape so that others can envision the devestation caused by an oil-based disaster. We hope that putting images of such devastation in a localized context will make them more relatable and discourage future negligent treatment of mother earth's resources.

## Tools
Spillter was created using Python, Numpy and OpenCV. It also makes use of the amazing [Somatic.io](http://www.somatic.io/) online image processing service.
